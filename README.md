# Scrapers
I started working on this out of curiosity to learn webscraping and collect data for my own purpose. The outcome of this are there in the scripts [Scripts](https://github.com/abhinavgairola/News_Scraper/tree/master/Scripts) and [Sec_Edgar](https://github.com/abhinavgairola/News_Scraper/tree/master/Sec_Edgar). The scripts essentially scraps abc.com and security and exchange commision webpages. I am still working on the [Sec_Edgar](https://github.com/abhinavgairola/News_Scraper/tree/master/Sec_Edgar) scripts so it is still a work in progress.
