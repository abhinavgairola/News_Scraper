And Evanston, like many cities across the country, embraced the practice of redlining.", "\"Redlining was a federal project to determine the market values of areas and neighborhoods,\" Robinson explained. \"[There were] four categories, 'A' being the highly desired area, 'D' the lower, lowest-value properties. The 'D' areas were usually relegated to the Black community. 'D' was always in red.\"", "In Evanston, Black residents were moved into a triangle-shaped area that became the 5th Ward, deliberately segregating them from white families, sought-after property, and ultimately, wealth.", "The 5th Ward was bordered by what was then a sewage canal on one side and far removed from public transportation and the city's downtown. According to Robinson's report, homes in the area had smaller lot sizes, and at the time, many had no electricity, water or sewers.", "\"The only option to buy in Evanston was basically in the 5th Ward,\" Robinson said. \"Banks in Evanston would not loan to Black families for housing [and] the real estate agencies would not show you anything other than the 5th Ward.\"", "In the late 1940s, the city also demolished some homes belonging to Black families that were outside of the 5th Ward -- or physically took them from their foundations and moved them into the redlined boundaries.", "\"The historic redlining impacts our community today,\" Rue Simmons said. \"That map still is the map of our concentrated Black community, our disinvestment, our inferior infrastructure.\"", "Today, white people in Evanston make nearly double the income and have double the home value of their Black neighbors according to the most recent U.S. Census.

Black residents currently make up 16% of Evanston's population, but, Rue Simmons pointed out, \"we've had much higher in the past.\"", "Now, according to Rue Simmons, the $25,000 reparations benefit for housing is meant to combat \"a lack of affordability, lack of access to living wage careers here in the city, and a lack of sense of place.\"", "Evanston proposed a novel idea to fund reparations -- a 3% tax on newly legal recreational marijuana sales.", "\"It's the most appropriate use for that sales tax,\" Simmons said. \"In our city, 70% of the marijuana arrests were in the Black community. And we are 16% of the community.
